This is a collection of FFMPEG scripts I use pretty much every day. 

Convert.sh will take a .webm, .mkv, etc. file and convert it into a twitter/discord/youtube useable .mp4.

Trim.sh will allow you to trim a video file from a starting timestamp to an ending timestamp.

Use --help or --h when running these scripts for a usage explanation.
